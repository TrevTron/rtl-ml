## TL;DR

- ✅ **87.5% accuracy** classifying 8 real-world radio signal types
- ✅ **$220 total hardware** (Indiedroid Nova + RTL-SDR Blog V4)
- ✅ **No cloud, no GPU** - runs entirely on ARM edge device
- ✅ **Complete pipeline** - capture → train → classify
- ✅ **Real signals** - validated with decoder tools, not synthetic data

---

## What It Classifies

| Signal | Frequency | Test Accuracy | Example Use |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| ✈️ ADS-B (Aircraft) | 1090 MHz | 100% | Track planes overhead |
| 🛰️ NOAA APT (Satellite) | 137.62 MHz | 100% | Weather satellite band** |
| 📡 ISM Sensors | 433.92 MHz | 100% | Tire pressure, weather stations |
| 📻 FM Broadcast | 98.7 MHz | 100% | Commercial radio |
| 🌤️ NOAA Weather | 162.4 MHz | 100% | Emergency weather alerts |
| 📟 Pager | 152.84 MHz | 100% | Medical/emergency paging |
| 📡 APRS | 144.39 MHz | 33%* | Ham radio position reports |
| 📊 Noise | 145.0 MHz | 67%* | Baseline noise floor |

*APRS and noise show confusion due to sparse packet structure - both exhibit sporadic bursts. This is authentic ML behavior, not "100% accuracy" clickbait.

**Note: NOAA APT transmissions ended August 2025 when NOAA-15 was decommissioned. Captures at 137.62 MHz represent the RF environment at that frequency (historical APT band). The classifier distinguishes this frequency's characteristics from other bands. For active satellite imagery, see Meteor-M LRPT at 137.1/137.9 MHz.

## Why Feature Extraction Instead of Deep Learning?

**TL;DR:** Feature extraction + Random Forest was chosen over deep learning (CNNs, RNNs) for practical reasons.

### The Data Challenge

| Approach | Training Samples Needed | Our Dataset | Result |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Feature Extraction + Random Forest** | 200-500 | 240 ✅ | 87.5% accuracy |
| **Deep Learning (CNN/RNN)** | 10,000-100,000 | 240 ❌ | Would overfit badly |

**Reality:** Capturing 10,000+ validated RF samples is impractical for a single-person project. Each signal needs validation with decoder tools.

### Practical Advantages

✅ **No GPU Required**
- Runs on ARM CPU (Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- Training: 2-3 minutes
- Inference: 14ms on Pi 5, 12ms on Nova

✅ **Tiny Model Size**
- Random Forest: 186KB
- Typical CNN: 50-200MB (270-1000× larger)
- Easy to distribute and version control

✅ **Interpretable Features**
- Can see which features (power, FFT peak, bandwidth, etc.) drive predictions
- Helps debug misclassifications
- Deep learning = black box

✅ **Fast Iteration**
- Add new signal type: 30 samples + 3min training
- Deep learning: Need 1000+ samples + hours of GPU training

✅ **Edge Deployment**
- Works on low-power ARM devices
- No cloud/server infrastructure needed
- Perfect for IoT/embedded use cases

### When to Use Deep Learning Instead

Consider CNNs/RNNs if you:
- Have 10,000+ labeled samples per class
- Have GPU resources available
- Need >95% accuracy
- Can afford longer development time
- Work with complex modulation schemes

For this project's scope (8 common signal types, hobbyist hardware, real-time classification), **feature extraction + Random Forest is the pragmatic choice.**

### References

Inspired by similar approaches in RF signal classification research:
- O'Shea et al. "Over-the-Air Deep Learning Based Radio Signal Classification" (2017) - showed CNNs need massive datasets
- Ramjee et al. "Fast Deep Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification" (2019) - 100K+ training samples used
- Our approach: Practical, reproducible, works with realistic data constraints

## How It Works

### 1. Signal Capture
```
RTL-SDR V4 → USB → ARM SBC → Python (pyrtlsdr)
```
Captures 0.5 seconds of IQ samples at 1.024 MSPS (ARM-optimized rate to prevent USB overflow).

### 2. Feature Extraction

**18 numerical features** extracted from each sample:

| Category | Features | What They Capture |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Power** (5) | mean, std, max, min, median | Signal strength characteristics |
| **FFT** (4) | mean, std, max, peak index | Frequency domain distribution |
| **I/Q** (4) | in-phase & quadrature stats | Complex signal structure |
| **Phase** (4) | phase mean, std, derivatives | Modulation characteristics |
| **Bandwidth** (1) | signal width at -20dB | Frequency occupancy |

### 3. Machine Learning

**Random Forest classifier** (100 decision trees) trained on 240 real-world samples.

| Model | Cross-Validation | Test Accuracy | Why |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-----|
| **Random Forest** ✅ | 83.9% ± 2.9% | **87.5%** | Best performance, fast inference |
| SVM (RBF) | 62.0% ± 4.7% | 64.6% | Struggles with non-linear features |
| K-NN (k=5) | 73.0% ± 8.2% | 77.1% | Sensitive to noise |

**Model stats:**
- Size: 186KB (fits in RAM easily)
- Inference time: < 100ms per sample
- Training time: 2-3 minutes on Nova

```

**Perfect classification (100% recall):**
- ✅ ADS-B, FM, ISM, NOAA_APT, Weather, Pager

**Confusion areas:**
- ⚠️ APRS ↔ Noise: Sparse packets look similar to noise bursts
- **Fix**: Add packet detection features (future improvement)

| Power bursts from aircraft transponders | Satellite downlink with FM subcarrier | 20.6x burst ratio from sensors | Wideband signal (~200 kHz) |

| NOAA Weather (162.4 MHz) | Pager (152.84 MHz) | APRS (144.39 MHz) | Noise (145 MHz) |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| ![Weather](visualizations/NOAA_weather_spectrum.png) | ![Pager](visualizations/pager_spectrum.png) | ![APRS](visualizations/APRS_spectrum.png) | ![Noise](visualizations/noise_spectrum.png) |
| Continuous 14.4 dB SNR signal | 12.7 dB SNR packet bursts | Sparse ham radio packets | Baseline noise floor |

## API Usage

### Simple Classification

```python
from src.classify_live import classify_signal

# Classify FM radio at 98.7 MHz
prediction, confidence, probabilities = classify_signal(98.7e6)

print(f"Signal: {prediction} ({confidence*100:.0f}% confidence)")
# Output: Signal: FM_broadcast (94% confidence)
```

### Batch Scanning

```python
# Scan multiple frequencies
frequencies = {
    'ADS-B': 1090e6,
    'FM Radio': 98.7e6,
    'NOAA Weather': 162.4e6,
}

for name, freq in frequencies.items():
    pred, conf, _ = classify_signal(freq)
    print(f"{name}: {pred} ({conf*100:.0f}%)")
```

### Custom Feature Extraction

```python
from src.signal_features import SignalFeatureExtractor
from rtlsdr import RtlSdr

# Capture signal
sdr = RtlSdr()
sdr.sample_rate = 1.024e6
sdr.gain = 40
sdr.center_freq = 1090e6
samples = sdr.read_samples(512000)
sdr.close()

# Extract 18 features
extractor = SignalFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features(samples)

print(f"Features: {features}")
# Array of 18 numbers ready for ML model
```

## Troubleshooting

### "PLL not locked" warnings
Normal RTL-SDR behavior. Ignore - captures work fine.

### USB overflow errors
Use ARM-optimized sample rate: `sdr.sample_rate = 1.024e6`

### Low accuracy (< 70%)
- Check antenna covers your frequencies
- Capture more samples (50+ per class)
- Verify signals are actually present
- Retrain model

See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for complete guide.
